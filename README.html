<h1 id="geometry_processing_project">Conformal Quaternion Based Mesh (Re)Construction  </h1>

<p><strong>To get started:</strong> Clone this repo to your local machine</p>

<h2 id="installation_layout_and_compilation">Installation, Layout, and Compilation</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a folder called build</li>
<li>Run CMake at the same level as the build folder, with the build folder as the target. Be sure to use an x64 compiler</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="execution">Execution</h2>

<p>Once built, run deformation. It takes up a lot of RAM so be prepared for that. The default is deforming a sphere into a head. To change this you can change the paths in main.cpp</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
This project attempts to construct a mesh given a point cloud. To do so we begin with a seed mesh and deform it in such as way that it becomes the mesh implied by the point cloud. 
</p>

<h2 id="spin_transformations">Spin Transformations</h2>
<p>
To do so we must first go over some of the results from the paper <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/SpinTransformations/paper.pdf">Spin Transformations of Discrete Surfaces</a> by Keenan et al
</p>

<p>
Keenan et al build on previous results detailing so called "spin transformations" of surfaces. These are transformations of a surface $f$ by a quaternion $\lambda$ defined by:
</p>

<p>
$d\tilde{f} = \bar{\lambda} df \lambda$
</p>

<p>
where $df$ and $d\tilde{f}$ are the differential one forms associated with the orignal surface $f$ and transformed surface $\tilde{f}$. 
In their paper they develop a discrete version of this equation by assigning each vertex $v_{i}$ a quaternion $\lambda_{i}$. The relationship between the original vertices 
and the transformed vertices is constructed as a Poisson problem over the edges of the meshes:
</p>

<p>
$\Delta \tilde{f} = \nabla \cdot \tilde{e}$
</p>

<p>
Discretizing this equation leads to: 
</p>

<p>
$\mat{L}\vec{\tilde{f}} = \mat{D}\vec{\tilde{e}}$
</p>

<p>
Where:
<ul> 
    <li>$\vec{\tilde{e}}$ is a $\mathbb{H}^{|E| \times 1}$ vector of quaternions representing each edge in the transformed mesh</li>
    <li>$\vec{\tilde{f}}$ is a $\mathbb{H}^{|V| \times 1}$ vector of quaternions representing each vertex in the transformed mesh</li>
    <li>$\mat{L}$ is the $\mathbb{R}^{|V| \times |V|}$ cotangent laplacian</li>
    <li>$\mat{D}$ is the $\mathbb{R}^{|V| \times |E|}$ discrete divergence operator</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This system can be solved in a least squares sense for $\tilde{f}$
</p>

<blockquote>
<h5 id="quaternion_vectors">Hold the phone. Quaternion vectors?</h5>
<p>
So you might be wondering how exactly $\tilde{e}$ and $\tilde{f}$ each represents edges and vertices. After all each one is just a vector of quaternions. Keenan et all use the following embedding of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ into $\mathbb{H}$. 
Each vector $\vec{p}=(x,y,z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is mapped to a purely imaginary quaternion $(0,x,y,z)$ So the vector $\vec{\tilde{e}} \in \mathbb{H}^{|E| \times 1}$ is represented 
as an expanded vector $\vec{\tilde{e}}_{\mathbb{R}} \in \mathbb{R}^{4|E| \times 1}$. Similarly for $\vec{\tilde{f}}$.
</p>
<h5 id="quaternion_matrix">That's great, but what about $\mat{L}$ and $\mat{D}$?</h5>

<p>Ah, good question! One way to represent any quaterion $q = (a,b,c,d)$ is with a $4 \times 4$ matrix $Q$</p>

<p>
$\begin{bmatrix}
a & -b & -c & -d\\
b & a & -c & d \\
c & d & a & -b \\
d & -c & -b & a \\
\end{bmatrix}$
</p>

<p>
This representation has many useful properties such as $q_{1}q_{2} = q_{3} \iff Q_{1}Q_{2} = Q_{3}$ and $\bar{q} = Q^{T}$. For our purposes we consider the entries of $\mat{L}$ and $\mat{D}$ as purely real quaternions. 
As such each entry gets blown up to a diagonal $4 \times 4$ block in the real versions of $\mat{L}$ and $\mat{D}$
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So if we know the transformed vertices $\vec{\tilde{e}}$ we can solve for the transformed vertex positions $\vec{\tilde{f}}$. So what's the relationship between $\vec{e}$ and $\vec{\tilde{e}}$? 
The details are in the paper so I'll just state the final result
</p>

<p>
$\tilde{e}_{ij} = \frac{1}{3}\bar{\lambda}_{i}e_{ij}\lambda_{i} + \frac{1}{6}\bar{\lambda}_{i}e_{ij}\lambda_{j} + \frac{1}{6}\bar{\lambda}_{j}e_{ij}\lambda_{i} + \frac{1}{3}\bar{\lambda}_{j}e_{ij}\lambda_{j}$
</p>

<p>
Recalling the quaternion multiplication is not commutative. Here $e_{ij}$ is the quaternion representation of the edge vector connecting vertex $i$ to vertex $j$
</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>
Our goal is to find an appropriate vector of quaternions $\vec{\lambda} = (\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\ldots,\lambda_{n})$ that will deform the seed mesh into the mesh implied by the point cloud. 
To do that we will need some way to measuring how "good" the resuling mesh is. As such we will cast this problem as an energy minimization problem. The first step in this direction is defining our energy
</p>

<h2 id="energy">Energy</h2>
<p>
There are two easy to implement energies to consider for this kind of problem: point-to-point and point-to-plane. For the following discussion we will be putting aside 
the fact that we are dealing with a point cloud sampling of $\tilde{f}$ and instead imagine it as a manifold
</p>

<h3 id="point_to_point">Point to point</h3>
<p>
Point to point energy measures the distance between points on the seed mesh and their closest point on the target mesh (or vice versea). 
Denoting by $P_{\tilde{f}}(x)$ the closest point on the target mesh $\tilde{f}$ to a given point $x$ on the seed mesh $f$ we can define the energy as follows:
</p>

<p>
$E = \int\limits_{x \in f}||x - p(x)||^{2}df$ 
</p>

<p>
Where $p = P_{\tilde{f}}(x)$. Since we will be deforming the seed mesh according to the vector $\vec{\lambda}$ we seek to miniminze this energy with respect to $\lambda$. 
In order to make the dependence on $\lambda$ more explicit lets rewrite the energy minimzation problem as
</p>

<p>
$\min\limits_{\vec{\lambda}} E(\vec{\lambda}) = \min\limits_{\vec{\lambda}} \int\limits_{x \in f}||x(\vec{\lambda}) - p(x(\vec{\lambda}))||^{2}df$
</p>

<p>Here $x(\vec{\lambda})$ represents the position of the point $x \in f$ after $f$ is transformed by $\vec{\lambda}$.</p>

<h3 id="point_to_plane">Point to plane</h3>
<p>
Point to plane energy requires some extra information. If in addition to the spacial position of each point $z \in \tilde{f}$ we also have a normal vector $\vec{n}_{z}$ 
at that point then we can use point to plane energy:
</p>

<p>
$E(\vec{\lambda}) = \int\limits_{x \in f}((x(\vec{\lambda}) - p(x(\vec{\lambda})))\cdot \vec{n}_{p})^{2}df$ 
</p>

<p>
This energy is measuring the distance between a point $x \in f$ and the plane defined by $p \in \tilde{f}$ and $n_{p}$. It is a looser restriction since the points $x$ and $y$ 
need only lie in the same plane for their contribution to the energy to be zero
</p>

<h2 id="minimizing_the_energy">Minimizing the energy</h2>
<h3 id="ICP"> Iterative Closest Point </h3>
<p>
We will be using an energy minimization technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_closest_point">Iterative Closest Point</a> (ICP) whereby we use samples from the meshes involved to approximate $E(\vec{\lambda})$
These are two approches to doing this:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Sample the point cloud and for each point in the sample project it onto the seed mesh to find its closest point</li>
<li>Sample the seed mesh and for each point in the sample loop over the points in the point cloud to find its closest point</li>
</ul>

<p>
We will refer to this as "cloud to mesh" and "mesh to cloud" respectively. In practice it works best to alternate between both methods. In the code from the repo this switch happens if the energy seems to have plateaued between multiple ICP iterations
</p>

<p>Once we have our $k$ pairs $(\vec{x}_{i},\vec{p}_{i})_{i=1,...,k}$ our energies become:</p>
<p>
$E(\vec{\lambda}) \approx \frac{1}{k}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}||\vec{x}_{i}(\vec{\lambda}) - \vec{p}_{i}||^{2} \\
E(\vec{\lambda}) \approx \frac{1}{k}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}((\vec{x}_{i}(\vec{\lambda}) - \vec{p}_{i}) \cdot \vec{n}_{i})^{2}$
</p>

<h3 id="gradient_decent"> Gradient decent </h3>
<p>
Even after making this approxiation we still are faced with a major issue. The relationship between $\vec{x}_{i}$ and $\vec{x}_{i}(\lambda)$ is a complicated one involving solving a least squares problem. As such finding a closed form minimizer 
$\tilde{\vec{\lambda}}$ is difficult. Instead we will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient decent</a>. Gradient decent is an iterative algorithm that alternates between 2 steps:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Compute $\vec{\beta} = \nabla E(\vec{\lambda})|_{\lambda = \eta}$</li>
    <li>Update $\vec{\eta}$ by $\vec{\eta} \rightarrow \vec{\eta} - \alpha||\vec{\beta}||$</li>
</ul>

<p> 
Where $\alpha > 0$ is a parameter that we set to control how far we step in the gradient direction. This works because the gradient always points in the direction of steepest change.
The negative sign in the second step ensures that we will be stepping "downhill" towards a minimum instea of "uphill" towards a maximum. 
All thats required to start the algorithm is an inital guess at the minimizer $\vec{\tilde{\lambda}} \approx \vec{\eta}_{0} \in \mathbb{H}^{|V| \times 1}$. For our purposes we use $\vec{\eta}_{0} = (\mathbb{I},\mathbb{I},...,\mathbb{I})$ where $\mathbb{I}$ is 
the identity transformation quaternion $\mathbb{I}=(1,0,0,0)$; which represents no rotation or scale.
</p>

<h2 id="bringing_it_together">Bringing it all together</h2>
<p>
We are now in a place to dicuss our algorithm as a whole.
